# Proto React
This is my personal Boilerplate I use to build React apps.

- __React__ - build awesome SPA apps.
- __Redux__ - manage your state.
- __Babel__ - use awesome ES6 features.
- __ESLint__ - write awesome code.
- __Jest__ - test your code.
- __Express__ - see your work in a browser.

## Commands
- `yarn install` - install dependencies.
- `yarn watch` - build for development.
- `yarn build` - build for production.
- `yarn serve` - start local server.
- `yarn test` - run test suite.
- `yarn test:coverage` - run test suite and report coverage.
- `yarn watch & yarn serve` - runs both `watch` and `serve` commends.
