# Proto React
This is my personal Boilerplate I use to build React apps.

- __React__ - build awesome SPA apps.
- __Redux__ - manage your state.
- __Babel__ - use awesome ES6 features.
- __ESLint__ - write awesome code.
- __Jest__ - test your code.

## Getting Started
Install the dependencies and build.

```
npm install
npm run watch
```

Serve your public directory.

## Build for production

```
npm run build
```
